Where the horarium comes from:

Horai (The seasons) are the 12 daughters of Helios and Selene
from whom 'selenium' comes, and each daughter is a month of
the year. Long afterwards the meaning of Horai had been shifted
to '12 hours of a day', and it is especially impressive for me
that the word 'horarium' is used as religous(sacred) diary or
schedule in Catholic Churches.

As you know, our framework comes from the Selenium like as
Horai come from Selene. So I've decided to name our framework
as 'The Horarium'.
